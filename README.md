E01: train a trigram language model, i.e. take two characters as an input to predict the 3rd one. Feel free to use either counting or a neural net. Evaluate the loss; Did it improve over a bigram model?
    Bigram Model Loss: 2.470531940460205
    Trigram Model Loss: 2.2569618225097656

    Yes so the trigram model technically performs better.
E02: split up the dataset randomly into 80% train set, 10% dev set, 10% test set. Train the bigram and trigram models only on the training set. Evaluate them on dev and test splits. What can you see?
    What does it mean to evaluate? 

    Trigram: 
    DEVELOPMENT SET LOSS
    2.3971099853515625
    Testing SET LOSS
    2.7449393272399902

    Bigram:
    DEVELOPMENT SET LOSS
    2.4541823863983154
    Testing SET LOSS
    2.580836534500122





E03: use the dev set to tune the strength of smoothing (or regularization) for the trigram model - i.e. try many possibilities and see which one works best based on the dev set loss. What patterns can you see in the train and dev set loss as you tune this strength? Take the best setting of the smoothing and evaluate on the test set once and at the end. How good of a loss do you achieve?

0.01: 
DEVELOPMENT SET LOSS
2.3854122161865234

0.1:
DEVELOPMENT SET LOSS
2.36171293258667

1:
DEVELOPMENT SET LOSS
2.4328935146331787

It looks like the loss is parabolic, it goes to a certain level, before coming up again. 



E04: we saw that our 1-hot vectors merely select a row of W, so producing these vectors explicitly feels wasteful. Can you delete our use of F.one_hot in favor of simply indexing into rows of W?
E05: look up and use F.cross_entropy instead. You should achieve the same result. Can you think of why we'd prefer to use F.cross_entropy instead?
E06: meta-exercise! Think of a fun/interesting exercise and complete it.
